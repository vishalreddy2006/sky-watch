Deploying to Render

This repository appears to be a static site (no package.json found). It contains:

- `index.html` (SPA entry) referencing assets in `/assets`
- `assets/index-dtgck9wr.js` and `assets/index-cgsbvt6i.css` (built JS/CSS)
- `weather-favicon.svg` and `favicon.ico`
- `netlify.toml` (Netlify config) — not used by Render but informative
- `200.html` (SPA fallback) — added to support client-side routing on Render

Recommended Render service: Static Site
- Root: connect this repository to Render as a Static Site service.
- Build command: (none) - leave blank if you're deploying the built files as-is.
- Publish directory: `/` (the repo root) or specify `.` in Render UI.
- If you instead need to run a build, add `package.json` with appropriate scripts and set build command to `npm run build` and publish directory to `dist`.

Notes and next steps
- If your project is already built (assets are present), Render can serve the repo directly as a static site.
- If you need a build step (source files missing), add `package.json` and build files. Example minimal package.json provided in this repo upon request.
- Configure custom domains, redirects, or environment vars in Render dashboard as needed.

Contact
- If you want, I can add a minimal `package.json` and `build` script or create a Render-specific `render.yaml` config.
